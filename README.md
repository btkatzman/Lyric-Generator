# Lyric-Generator
This project generates song lyrics in the style of different artists using a neural network trained on existing song lyrics data. The model uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to predict the next word in a sequence and generate new verses and choruses based on seed text. The training data comes from a CSV file containing song lyrics by different artists.
